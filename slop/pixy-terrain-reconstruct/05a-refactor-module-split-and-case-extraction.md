# Pixy Terrain — Part 05a: Module Split & Case Extraction

**Series:** Reconstructing Pixy Terrain
**Part:** 05a of 18 (addendum)
**Status:** Folded into Part 05

## This addendum has been merged into Part 05.

Part 05 now covers both the module split (`marching_squares.rs` → `marching_squares/` directory) and the case generator with extracted named functions from the start. There is no separate refactoring step.
